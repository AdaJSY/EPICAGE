# EPICAGE

EPICAGE implements the core model from our paper [Integrating Epigenetic and Phenotypic Features for Biological Age
Estimation in Cancer Patients via Multimodal Learning].

## Prerequisites

This project is designed to run on **Google Colab** with a **T4 GPU**.  
Additional dependencies can be installed as shown in the provided code scripts.

Our pipeline includes a feature selection step using **BorutaShap**.  
Due to environment limitations in Google Colab, this step should be performed locally.

## Reproduce Results

Example scripts to run EPICAGE are listed in EPICAGE.ipynb
