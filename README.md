## Prerequisites

This project is designed to run on **Google Colab** with a **T4 GPU**.  
Additional dependencies can be installed as shown in the provided code scripts.

Our pipeline includes a feature selection step using **BorutaShap**.  
Due to environment limitations in Google Colab, this step should be performed locally.
